# Synchronous and Asynchronous

- **Synchronous**
  Synchronous JavaScript refers to the traditional way of executing JavaScript code, where each operation is performed in a sequential and blocking manner. In other words, each line of code is executed **_one after the other_**, and the program will wait for each operation to finish before moving on to the next one. If an operation takes a long time to complete, it can potentially slow down the entire application, making it less responsive.
